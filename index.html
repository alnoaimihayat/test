          I am learning Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk">University of Salford.</a>
          I decided to study my course at Salford because:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            the staff are <em>so</em> friendly,
          </li>
          <li>
            it is easy to get to by train, and
          </li>
          <li>
            they use GNU/Linux (some of the time)
          </li>
        </ol>
        My course is provided by the School of Computing, Science & Engineering, which is based in the Newton Building. The Newton Building was not built recently, and would benefiit from some improvements. If it were my decision I would:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Improve the lightning in the second floor computer labs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fix the heating!</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Decorate the staff offices<ul>
              <li>
                paint the walls,
              </li>
              <li>
                replace the carpet,
              </li>
              <li>
                replace the curtains with blinds
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve the building entrance
          </li>
        </ul>
